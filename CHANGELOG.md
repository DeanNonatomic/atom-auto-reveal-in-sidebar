## 0.1.0 - First Release
* Adds inital basic functionality to call 'tree-view:reveal-in-sidebar' whenever a file is opened

## 0.2.0 - Fixed focus issue
* Fixed small issue where the sidebar was being focused after opening a file. Focus will now return to whatever pane was active before reveal was called

## 0.3.0 - Replaced deprecated calls
* Replaced deprecated workspaceView calls
* Removed options for enable/disable as this seemed redundant
